arrays:

linkedlist:
Dynamic version of arrays 
size changes dynamically 
A structure that can be visualised as a chain with different nodes where each node is a different element 
1. pointer: variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It points to the location in memory 
where the data stored.
allows to directly access and manipulate data by returning to its memory address 

2. node and node* : node is a structure that contains data and the pointer to the next node 
node* is a pointer variable that stores address of the node its pointing to.
